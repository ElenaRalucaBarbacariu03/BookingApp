# BookingApp
Here is an C# booking app. 
In this app, I used different Windows Forms for the interface of the booking process. Users start by selecting their preferred type of room and the number of rooms needed. Following this, the price per room per night is displayed on a label. The user then inputs their check-in and check-out dates, allowing the app to calculate the duration of the stay. Based on this information, a function determines the total cost. Finally, users enter their personal information to complete the booking.
